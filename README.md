# Tabgether
This project uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript

---

This is a simple chrome extension created to open a collection of tabs with 1 click.

---

### How does it work?
It saves the collections details using the Chrome Storage API (local)

### What about the limits?
~~The limits are hard coded. They are:~~
- ~~5 tabs per collection~~
- ~~7 collections per Chrome profile~~

***limits removed***

### What about the colors?
The layout colors can be toggled between light and dark mode in the settings page.
The collection ID color is generated randomly at collection creation and can have one of the following colors:
